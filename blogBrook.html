		<p class="maincontent">I knew a girl in school named Brook. She had long hair and could sing beautifully. We got along well. Ended up in alot of the same classes from no lack of trying. We eventually started hanging out in more than just class. We shared our thoughts, dreams and fears. Then one day we went on a canoe trip with some friends and while we were on the water I told her that I'm actually three raccoons in a trenchcoat, whose life goal was to start a nature blog uncovering all the reasons why humans should destroy all nature and build more dumpsters for raccoons to feed from. She never talked to me after that.</p>
